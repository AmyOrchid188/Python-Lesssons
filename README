Hello!

I've been programming for over 10 years but today I decided to learn Python. I bought a nice book, it's called Learn Python the Hardway. It recommends just doing the lessons out of the book to learn some skills such as attention to detail, type more efficiently, and just go over the basics.

Anyways I thought it would be fun to just go word-by-word by the book and see what I gain from it. 

So far it's really nice to work with and I recommend giving it a shot.
